### LangGraphs

- In langchain, an agent is a system powered by a language model that decides what action to take
- there is then an agent runtime, basically runs that agent in a loop.
    - Calls that agent
    - Decides what action to take
    - Takes that action 
    - Records the observation 
    - Passes that back in 
    - Starts to loop over again & continues going through that loop until the agent decides that it is finished
